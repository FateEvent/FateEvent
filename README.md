# About me

Hey,

Fab here, student @ 42 school, currently learning C and C++.
I learnt the fundamentals of HTML and CSS (you can find some of my works on my CodePen page, [here](https://codepen.io/Fab_), and I practiced a little bit Javascript and Python.

Fascinated by programming and IT, I'm really curious about exploring new concepts and discovering languages and ways of coding.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have suggestions/questions.
